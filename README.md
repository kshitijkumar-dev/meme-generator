## ⚡ Meme Machine-Instant Random Meme Generator Web App
Meme Machine is a simple web application that displays random memes using a public API.  
This is my first frontend project, built to practice core web development concepts.
I used AI tools as a learning assistant while building this project, but i tried to implement and understand everything myself as much as i could.
The goal of this project was to understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together and how to fetch data using an API.

## 🚀 Features
- Automatically loads a meme when the site opens  
- Generate new random memes 
- Dark mode toggle  
- Download meme option  
- Smooth hover animations  
- Loading indicator while fetching memes  

## 🧠 What I Learned
- DOM manipulation  
- Async / Await  
- Fetching data from APIs  
- Basic UI/UX improvements  
- Hosting a static website using GitHub Pages  

## 📌 Future Improvements
